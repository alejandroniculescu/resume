# Resume README

## Vision
In 2025, my focus is on consolidating my diverse experiences and aligning them with a role where I can thrive both personally and professionally. While I’ve embraced roles as an aspiring psychoanalyst, CEO of a Private Equity Fund, and Lead Mentor, my goal is to streamline these efforts into a career that feels cohesive and fulfilling.

## Goals for 2025
This year, I aspire to:
- Lead as **Head of Data**, focusing on ML Operations, behavioral analytics, and data at scale.
- Join a team as a **Developer Evangelist**, combining my engineering expertise with communication and advocacy.
- Contribute as a **Quant** to a boutique fund or VC, leveraging my technical and analytical skills.

## What I Bring
I envision my ideal work environment as a place where I can:
- Collaborate with a dedicated team.
- Review technical and strategic materials, from engineering work to investor decks.
- Engage with colleagues over lunch, share ideas, and contribute to a culture of growth and camaraderie.
- Travel to connect with customers, investors, and team members while writing thought leadership articles.

## Closing Thoughts
Few may understand the growing pains of navigating diverse passions and experiences to find a true "work-home." For me, it’s not about intellect, fame, or wealth—it’s about alignment. If these goals aren’t realized this year, I am content to wait and continue refining my path.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey.  Below is a lovely pyramid for your own amusement, as well as mine.
