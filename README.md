# resume
In 2025, my focus is on consolidating my diverse efforts into a cohesive career path.

As cool as it sounds being an aspiring psychonalyst, psychonalytic writer, CEO of a Private Equity Fund, Mentor, Lead Mentor, and Advisor to startups...

My goal is to streamline my passions and skills into a unified role.

To greet my staff at 9 am.  To get into my corner office, review the engineering work, slide decks, and investor relations.  To eat lunch with my team, make jokes.  To write my articles, and travel to see
customers, investors, and other team members. 

This year I hope to be head of data, a Developer Evangelist, or join a boutique fund or VC as a quant.

Few will understand the growing pains I experience, the desire to find a work-home that encourages and synergizes with my efforts.
It may sound lofty, arrogant, or even naive.  At the end of the day where one is in proportion to maslow's hierarchy of needs is
not inidicative of intellect, money, fame, or cunning.  It simply is.

And if none of this happens this year, I'm fine to wait as well.
