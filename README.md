# Resume README

In 2025, my focus is on consolidating my disparate efforts into a cohesive career path.

As cool as it sounds being an aspiring psychonalyst, psychonalytic writer, CEO of a Private Equity Fund, Mentor, Lead Mentor, and Advisor to startups...

My goal is to streamline my passions and skills into a unified role.

To greet my staff at 9 am. To get into my corner office, review the engineering work, slide decks, and investor relations. To eat lunch with my team, make jokes. To write my articles, and travel to see customers, investors, and other team members. And if this is all online, that's fine too, as long as we still get out for ramen or skiing every now and then.

This year I hope to be **head of data**, a developer evangelist, or quant for a boutique fund or VC.

Few will understand the growing pains I experience, the desire to find a work-home that encourages and synergizes with my efforts. It may sound lofty, arrogant, or even naive. At the end of the day where one is in proportion to maslow's hierarchy of needs is not inidicative of intellect, money, fame, or cunning. It simply is.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Does this mean you'll become a psychoanalyst and abandon software altogether?

**No**, not at all. I am not yet admitted into formal training; everything you see reflects my pre-training efforts. Including this on my resume highlights my multi-year commitment to a long-term goal.  

Many of my peers have "disappeared" post-IPO to pursue other interests like becoming DJs or "trustafarians." In contrast, I assure you that my path is grounded in rigor and discipline, much of which is rooted in my graph-theory and game-theory background. For example, I explain Bion's α function using Markov Chains and simple heuristic/graph concepts.

If admitted, the program will take 4–5 years to complete. During this time—and before or after—I plan to pivot into a tech- and analysis-backed wellness project.

### 2. Doesn't private equity take up a lot of your time?

**Yes and no.** I’m very efficient. Toward the end of my data engineering career, I was working only about an hour a day thanks to a heuristic-based classification of errors across different flow states, as well as automated deployments and testing.

The same efficiency applies to my work as a fund manager. I can’t be bothered to make cold calls or raise rounds—I’d rather focus on the areas I genuinely enjoy. For me, private equity serves more as a status symbol, a way to attend social events and become an advisor.  

Could I make private equity a career? Probably. But I don’t want to. Creating Gartner Hype Cycles or Nash Equilibriums for low-cardinality pseudo-random markets sounds tedious and uninspiring to me.
