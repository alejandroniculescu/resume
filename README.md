# Resume README

In 2025, my focus is on consolidating my diverse efforts into a cohesive career path.

As cool as it sounds being an aspiring psychonalyst, psychonalytic writer, CEO of a Private Equity Fund, Mentor, Lead Mentor, and Advisor to startups...

My goal is to streamline my passions and skills into a unified role.

To greet my staff at 9 am. To get into my corner office, review the engineering work, slide decks, and investor relations. To eat lunch with my team, make jokes. To write my articles, and travel to see customers, investors, and other team members. And if this is all online, that's fine too, as long as we still get out for ramen or skiing every now and then.

This year I hope to be **head of data**, a developer evangelist, or quant for a boutique fund or VC.

Few will understand the growing pains I experience, the desire to find a work-home that encourages and synergizes with my efforts. It may sound lofty, arrogant, or even naive. At the end of the day where one is in proportion to maslow's hierarchy of needs is not inidicative of intellect, money, fame, or cunning. It simply is.
