# Resume README

In 2025, my focus is on consolidating my disparate efforts into a cohesive career path.

As cool as it sounds being an aspiring psychonalyst, psychonalytic writer, CEO of a Private Equity Fund, Mentor, Lead Mentor, and Advisor to startups...

My goal is to streamline my passions and skills into a unified role.

To greet my staff at 9 am. To get into my corner office, review the engineering work, slide decks, and investor relations. To eat lunch with my team, make jokes. To write my articles, and travel to see customers, investors, and other team members. And if this is all online, that's fine too, as long as we still get out for ramen or skiing every now and then.

This year I hope to be **head of data**, a developer evangelist, or quant for a boutique fund or VC.

Few will understand the growing pains I experience, the desire to find a work-home that encourages and synergizes with my efforts. It may sound lofty, arrogant, or even naive. At the end of the day where one is in proportion to maslow's hierarchy of needs is not inidicative of intellect, money, fame, or cunning. It simply is.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. But Alexander doesn't this mean you'll become a psychonalyst and abandon software altogether?
   -No, I am yet to be admitted into formal training, everything you see is pre-training.  This is the first time I put that stuff on my resume, and I hope it shows my multi-year commitment for a long-term goal.  I have plenty of friends that have 'disappeared' post IPO to become Dj's and 'trustafarians.'  However, I assure you that the rigor and discipline is also rooted in my graph-theory and game-theory background.  For instance, I explain Bion's Î± function using Markov Chains and simple heuristic / graph concepts.
   Secondly, if admitted, the school will take me 4-5 years.
   -Lastly, Before, during, or after this program I will pivot into a tech and analysis backed wellness project.

2. Doesn't Private Equity take alot of your time?
   -Yes and No.  I'm very efficient. I was so efficient as a data engineer, towards the end of my career I was working an hour a day, many thanks to a heuristic based classification of errors amongst different flow states, as well as automated deployments and testing.  So it's the same for being a fund manager, I can't be bothered to make cold calls and raise rounds.  I'd rather do the other stuff above, which I clearly enjoy much more.  PE is more of a status symbol, a way to be invited into various social events, as well as to become an advisor.  Could I make PE a career - probably.  But I don't want to.  Creating Gartner Hype Cycles and Nash Equilibriums for low cardinality psuedo random markets sounds boring.
